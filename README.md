# Assessing Time-Varying Causal Effect Moderation in the Presence of Cluster-Level Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

##### Case study, simulations and estimation functions

The directories above correspond to the simulation in the paper *Assessing Time-Varying Causal Effects in the Presenceof Cluster-Level Treatment Effect Heterogeneity*. Results for each scenario are generated by the following R files.

File | Description
---- | ----
[Scenario 1](Scenario 1) | The first  scenario  concerns  the  estimation when  an  importantindividual-level moderator exists and proximal outcomes share a random cluster-level intercept350term that does not interact with treatment.
[Scenario 2](Scenario 2) | The second scenario extends the above generative model to includea random cluster-level intercept term that interacts with treatment.
[Scenario 3](Scenario 3) | In the third scenario, we assume the treatment effect for an individualdepends on the average state of all individuals in the cluster.
[Scenario 4](Scenario 4) | The fourth scenario considers the indirect effect.
